A shell script is a computer program designed to be run by the Unix/Linux 
shell which could be one of the following:

The Bourne Shell
The C Shell
The Korn Shell
The GNU Bourne-Again Shell

A shell is a "command-line interpreter" and "typical operations performed" 
by shell scripts include file manipulation, program execution, and printing text.

Shell Prompt
date

'Bourne shell' − If you are using a Bourne-type shell, the "$" character is the default prompt.

The Bourne Shell has the following subcategories −
* Bourne shell (sh)
* Korn shell (ksh)
* Bourne Again shell (bash)
* POSIX shell (sh)

"C shell" − If you are using a C-type shell, the "%" character is the default prompt

The different C-type shells follow −
* C shell (csh)
* TENEX/TOPS C shell (tcsh)


The original Unix shell was written in the "mid-1970s" 
by "Stephen R. Bourne" while he was at the AT&T Bell Labs in New Jersey.

"Bourne shell" was the first shell to appear on Unix systems, thus it is referred to as "the shell".
Bourne shell is usually installed as "/bin/sh" on most versions of Unix. For this reason, 
it is the shell of choice for writing scripts that can be used on different versions of Unix.
In this chapter, we are going to cover most of the Shell concepts that are based on the Borne Shell.


Shell Scripts:
The basic concept of a shell script is a list of commands, which are listed in the order of execution. A good shell script will have comments, preceded by # sign, describing the steps.

Example Script
test.sh

#!/bin/sh
pwd
ls

Save the above content and make the script executable −
chmod +x test.sh

run:
./test.sh

Variable Types:
    * Local Variables : A local variable is a variable that is present within the current instance of the shell.
    * Environment Variables: .env
    * Shell Variables: Some of these variables are environment variables
