What is devops ?

"DevOps is a combination of software development (dev) and operations (ops).
It is defined as a software engineering methodology which aims to integrate the work of development teams
and operations teams by facilitating a culture of collaboration and shared responsibility."

The DevOps lifecycle:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Plan 📋: Defining the project goals and requirements.
2. Code 💻: Writing and reviewing the software code.
3. Build 🛠️: Compiling the code into an executable artifact.
4. Test ⚙️: Conducting various tests to ensure quality.
5. Release 🚀: Packaging and preparing the build for deployment.
6. Deploy 🌐: Installing and configuring the software in the target environment.
7. Operate ⚙️: Managing and maintaining the software in production.
8. Monitor 📈: Collecting data on performance and usage to inform future planning.

Software deploy requirements:
-----------------------------
1. domain
2. network(VPC)
3. public ip, port open, public or private access
4. storages
5. db
6. frontend/backend

test:
    functional test
    integrity test
    security test
    vulnerability test
    unit test
    api test
    load testing
    then release (Artifact)
    artifact: deployable image or docker image

SDLC(Software development Life Cycle) ?
---------------------------------------
stage 1: Planning and Requirements Analysis
stage 2: Defining Requirements
stage 3: Architectural Design
stage 4: software development
stage 5: testing
stage 6: development and Maintenance


Agile Methodology ?
-------------------
The diagram illustrates a cyclical process that is characteristic of Agile development,
which typically includes iterative steps like:
* Plan (start of a cycle)
* Design
* Develop
* Test
* Deploy
* Review

DevOps after deployment:

secure : like port security
[
    plane-> create -> verify -> package -> deploy -> monitor -> repeat
]
Govern :

multiple services :
---------------------


**Common Roles and Responsibilities**
* Application & infrastructure planning, testing and development
* Maintaining **CI/CD** pipelines
* **Automation** implementation
* On-call, incident response and incident management
* **Monitoring**

What will you learn?:
---------------------
* GIT (VCS)
* Scripting (bash)
* Linux
* Networking (http, DNS, VPC, Subnetting, Routing)
* CI/CD (Jenkins, Git Action)
* Containerization (Docker) (50% of devops)
---------------------------------------------------
* Container Orchestration (Kubernetes)
* IaC and Provisioning (Terraform, Ansible)
* Cloud Services (AWS EC2, load balancer, S3, lambda, RDS, VPC)
* Monitoring (Prometheus & Grafana)
